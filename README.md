A python project to get files from Mobbin, code by Gemini, Codex, and Claude 4, no code by human, lol.

Recommend to deploy via Docker

### Install
Step 1: ```git clone https://github.com/DaleXiao/pMobbin ```

Step 2: Update the .env file with the token you get from browser

Step 3:
 ```docker-compose up -d --build ```

### What I have done
Loggin - support both Google account SSO, and Email + Password login
Search - it's now able to fetch content from Mobbin.
